# Findings: Pixel 11 Pro / Tensor G6 / Android 17

Measured 2026-08-22.

## Environment
- Pixel 11 Pro, codename grizzly, Android 17, SDK 37, build CD1A.260714.001.A9
- Upstream Telegram at 12.10.0 (7031). compileSdk 35, targetSdk 35, NDK 27.2.12479018

## Confirmed by measurement (stock Telegram, 2 recordings)
- Camera2 API is ON by default on this device. No debug menu toggle needed.
- Capture resolution 384x384 (MessagesController.roundVideoSize default, line 1635)
- Video bitrate ~1.01 Mbps (roundVideoBitrate default 1000)
- Audio bitrate ~65.6 kbps (roundAudioBitrate default 64)
- Encoder is told KEY_FRAME_RATE = 30 (InstantCameraView line 2113, 3210)
- videoEditedInfo.framerate hardcoded to 25 in three places (lines 2796, 2892, 3044)
- ACTUAL capture rate: front camera 58.6 and 59.1 fps, rear camera 39.1 fps
- Stock Telegram never sets CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE. The ISP free-runs.
- Result: ~17,173 bits per frame at 59 fps vs 33,773 budgeted at 30 fps

## Confirmed by source reading (Telegram iOS)
- CameraDevice.swift line 6: defaultFPS = 30.0
- Camera.swift line 101: round video path explicitly requests 30.0
- CameraDevice.swift 152-153, 193-194: activeVideoMin/MaxFrameDuration both locked
  to the same negotiated value. Hard lock, not a hint.
- CameraUtils.swift line 18: actualFPS() negotiates against
  activeFormat.videoSupportedFrameRateRanges, preferring fixed ranges
- CameraOutput.swift line 374: AVVideoAverageBitRateKey = 1,000,000

## Conclusion
iOS and Android target the SAME 30 fps and SAME 1 Mbps for circles.
The entire quality gap on this device is that iOS enforces the frame rate at the
capture device and Android does not. Each iOS frame gets ~2x the bits.

## Ruled out
- Camera switch cost: measured one 0.106s gap. Cheap. updateOutputConfigurations()
  is NOT worth pursuing. Perceived switch slowness is UI/preview latency, elsewhere.
- Over-sharpening: frame inspection shows blocking and mush, not edge halos.
  EDGE_MODE_HIGH_QUALITY is not the problem at this bitrate.

## Open
- Both recordings show audio ~1s longer than video, only ~0.1s explained by
  gaps; cause unexplained. With the AE fps fix applied, the overrun dropped to
  0.43s (from 1.4-3.0s at free-run) but is still nonzero; cause still
  unexplained.
- Desync on playback of a SENT message not yet tested.
- Perceived sped-up playback on a stock (Play Store) circle recorded at
  free-running ~59fps. The Play Store file's own frame timestamps are uniform
  (58.98fps measured, per-frame interval min 0.0159, max 0.0198 - a tight,
  consistent spread, not compressed toward either end), so timestamp
  compression is not demonstrated as the cause. Mechanism behind the
  perceived speed-up remains unknown.

## Next change
None queued. Face-weighted AE (below) matched face luma to iPhone; the
remaining frame-luma gap looks like a deliberate iOS metering-target
difference (room vs. face), not a bug to chase further right now.

## Stock 12.10.0 build (measured 2026-08-22)
- Built unmodified upstream in a separate worktree at
  ../telegram-stock-12.10.0, checked out at origin/master 3f03bfc73 (tip;
  one commit after "update to 12.10.0 (7031)" / 4e1a61eca, which only fixes
  a submodule URL scheme).
- Toolchain (JDK 17, NDK 27.2.12479018, SDK 35) matched what that commit's
  build.gradle already specifies, no override needed.
- Upstream master at this commit does NOT build clean: 4e1a61eca added
  `api project(':jlatexmath')` in TMessagesProj/build.gradle but never
  added the corresponding `include ':jlatexmath'` + projectDir remap to
  the top-level settings.gradle. Confirmed origin/master has no later
  fix (already fully fetched, 3f03bfc73 is tip). Real upstream gap, not
  a local environment issue.
- Fix applied only in the stock worktree's settings.gradle (2 lines,
  registration only, no app/source change):
  ```
  include ':jlatexmath'
  project(':jlatexmath').projectDir = file('TMessagesProj/lib/jlatexmath/jlatexmath')
  ```
- With that fix: `./gradlew :TMessagesProj_App:assembleAfatDebug` succeeds,
  88 tasks, ~5min. APK at
  TMessagesProj_App/build/outputs/apk/afat/debug/app.apk (113MB).

## Correction to "Stock Telegram never sets CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE" (measured 2026-08-22)
- That claim (in "Confirmed by measurement" above) was based on the Play Store
  install and is WRONG for the source at 12.10.0. Camera2Session.java (the
  round-video capture path, wired up from InstantCameraView via
  setRecordingVideo(true)) already hardcoded
  `captureRequestBuilder.set(CONTROL_AE_TARGET_FPS_RANGE, new Range<Integer>(30, 60))`
  whenever recordingVideo is true, unconditionally, with no check against
  CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES.
- Hypothesis: (30, 60) is likely not itself in this sensor's supported range
  list, and the HAL silently ignores/free-runs on an unsupported target
  range rather than erroring - which would reconcile "code sets it" with
  "measured 58-59fps". Not yet directly confirmed; the new PixelCamera logs
  below (once a circle is recorded) should show whether (30,60) was ever a
  reported-available range on this sensor.

## Applied the "next change" fix in the stock worktree (2026-08-22, hypothesis pending re-measurement)
- telegram-stock-12.10.0 is no longer byte-for-byte upstream: modified
  Camera2Session.java (only) to replace the hardcoded (30,60) with a proper
  pick from CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES.
- At camera-open time (in the constructor, right after characteristics are
  fetched, for both front and rear sessions independently): reads all
  available AE target fps ranges, logs each with tag `PixelCamera` (camera
  id + front/rear), picks a fixed 30/30 range if offered, else the
  narrowest range containing 30, logs the chosen range or logs clearly if
  none contains 30. The chosen range (if any) replaces the old hardcoded
  value inside the existing `if (recordingVideo)` block in
  updateCaptureRequest() - same gating as before, only the value changed.
- Verified the new code path (not just source, the actual built dex)
  reached the installed APK before installing.
- Installed to device as org.telegram.messenger.beta (versionCode 70319,
  versionName 12.10.0), side by side with the untouched Play Store
  org.telegram.messenger.
- To capture the new logs while recording a circle:
  `adb -s <device-ip>:<port> logcat -s PixelCamera:D`
- Still open: whether this actually changes the measured capture fps
  (needs a new recording + ffprobe pass, see below).

## Result: AE target fps range fix (measured 2026-08-22)
- PixelCamera logs at camera-open showed [30,30] present in this sensor's
  CONTROL_AE_AVAILABLE_TARGET_FPS_RANGES, so the fixed-30 branch was chosen
  (not the narrowest-containing-30 fallback).
- Confirmed: [30,60] - the value upstream unconditionally hardcodes in
  Camera2Session - is NOT in this sensor's available range list. This
  confirms the hypothesis above: upstream's hardcoded value was never
  valid on this hardware, so it was silently ignored and the ISP free-ran.
- With [30,30] actually applied: measured 30.01 fps, mean frame interval
  0.0333s (vs the free-running 58-59fps/59-front measured earlier).
- Bits per frame: ~34,800, up from ~17,300 at free-run - matches the ~2x
  gap predicted in Conclusion (iOS gets ~2x the bits per frame vs stock
  Android at the same target bitrate).
- Audio overrun (audio duration minus video duration) dropped from
  1.4-3.0s (stock, free-running) to 0.43s with the fix applied. Improved
  ~4-7x, but not zero - remains open, see above.

## Result: resolution/audio bump + exposure compensation (measured 2026-08-22)
- 448x448 capture resolution and 96kbps audio bitrate (both hardcoded in
  InstantCameraView, replacing the account-configured roundVideoSize/
  roundAudioBitrate defaults) applied and measured on-device.
- +0.7 EV exposure compensation (CONTROL_AE_EXPOSURE_COMPENSATION, computed
  from CONTROL_AE_COMPENSATION_STEP and clamped to
  CONTROL_AE_COMPENSATION_RANGE, cached at camera-open) applied and measured.
- Average luma moved from 127.7 (fps-fix baseline, no compensation) to 135.4
  with +0.7 EV applied. The iPhone reference is 167.2. So +0.7 EV of global
  exposure compensation closes only about a fifth of the brightness gap to
  iOS (7.7 of the needed ~39.5 luma, roughly 20%).
- Subjective visual comparison: Pixel output at 400px is grainier and darker
  than the iPhone despite resolving more detail. Global exposure compensation
  alone is not enough - see Next change (AE_REGIONS from face detection).

## Result: face-driven AE regions + EDGE_MODE_FAST (measured 2026-08-22)
- Back-to-back comparison, Pixel vs iPhone:
  - Face luma: Pixel 110.6 vs iPhone 114.1 - matched.
  - Frame luma: Pixel 132.2 vs iPhone 167.5 - still a large gap.
  - Reading: Apple exposes for the room (brighter overall frame); our
    CONTROL_AE_REGIONS metering exposes for the face specifically. The
    two cameras are choosing different metering targets, not one being
    "wrong." Keeping +0.7 EV as the baseline compensation on top of
    face metering.
- EDGE_MODE_FAST: at 800% zoom, visibly removes the edge-enhancement
  halos on fine facial detail with no loss of sharpness. No audio/video
  desync introduced: audio 8.62s vs video 8.30s, a 0.32s gap, consistent
  with the gap measured before this change.
- Caveat: brightness comparisons taken at different times are not directly
  comparable; only back-to-back recordings should be compared. Treat
  absolute luma numbers as directional, not precise, until re-measured
  under controlled/matched lighting.

## Result: NOISE_REDUCTION_MODE + face-gated exposure compensation (measured 2026-08-22)
- NOISE_REDUCTION_AVAILABLE_NOISE_REDUCTION_MODES reports only 0/1/2
  (OFF/FAST/HIGH_QUALITY) on both cameras - MINIMAL (3) is unavailable
  on this sensor, so FAST was chosen (the preferred fallback).
- NOISE_REDUCTION_MODE_FAST visibly cleans up skin grain without losing
  detail, and causes no desync.
- The +0.7 EV exposure compensation (global, from the earlier result)
  was blowing out highlights on the rear camera outdoors, where there's
  no face to meter on. Fixed by gating it on currentFaceAeRect being
  non-null and explicitly clearing it to 0 otherwise. Confirmed this
  restores correct sky and foliage colour on the rear camera outdoors.

## Audio effect availability on this device (measured 2026-08-23)
- `AutomaticGainControl.isAvailable()` returns `false` on the Pixel 11 Pro.
  `NoiseSuppressor.isAvailable()` and `AcousticEchoCanceler.isAvailable()`
  both return `true`.
- This means AGC was never actually attached in any measurement taken on
  this device: the previous bundled "Audio Effects" toggle called
  `AutomaticGainControl.create()` behind the same `isAvailable()` gate, so
  it was a no-op here the whole time. Every earlier A/B result labelled
  "effects on" reflects `NoiseSuppressor` alone, not noise suppression +
  AGC together - re-read those results with that in mind rather than as a
  combined-effects comparison.
- Not necessarily true on other hardware - `isAvailable()` is a HAL/device
  capability query, so a different phone could support AGC while lacking
  one of the other two.

## Microphone direction preference (measured 2026-08-29)
- `AudioRecord.setPreferredMicrophoneDirection()` returns `true` on the Pixel 11 Pro (both
  towards-user and away-from-user), but has no measurable effect. The active microphone
  reported by `getActiveMicrophones()` stays `address="bottom"` either way, and matched
  recordings (preference on vs. off) show no consistent audio level difference. A `true`
  return only means the platform accepted the request, not that it changed anything audible
  on this hardware - a different device could behave differently.
- `getActiveMicrophones()` has a metadata race worth knowing about, since it will confuse
  anyone reading that API's output: immediately after `startRecording()`, the framework's
  `native_get_active_microphones()` call comes back empty for the newly-active input (or its
  entries get filtered out by `AudioManager.setPortIdForMicrophones()` failing to match the
  current input port), so `AudioRecord.getActiveMicrophones()` falls back to
  `AudioManager.microphoneInfoFromAudioDeviceInfo(getRoutedDevice())` - a `MicrophoneInfo`
  built from nothing but the routed device, with `description="21"` (empty port name + numeric
  device id), `group=-1/-1`, and `directionality`/`position`/`orientation` all `UNKNOWN`. It
  settles to the full HAL-declared entry (`description="builtin_mic_1"`, `group=0/0`,
  `directionality=OMNI`, real `position`/`orientation` coordinates) about 1.5 seconds into the
  recording, confirmed by re-querying at that point in two separate test recordings. An idle
  probe that never calls `startRecording()` at all is permanently stuck in that same fallback,
  since there's never an active capture stream for the enrichment lookup to resolve against -
  it isn't a special case, it's the same branch with no active input to ever get past.
